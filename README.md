For more details check the backend branch, this main branch has been modified to meet the server requirements on our servers.
Logic remains same, but instead of openswoole, we use apache .htaccess ,to rewrite the api requests to a file called api.php.
And also scheduler has also been changed from openswoole Timer to a simple while loop.
